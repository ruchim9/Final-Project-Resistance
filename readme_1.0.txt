Overview:
This final project is to print and estimate statistics about the game Resident Evil Resistance. It prints information based on global statisitcs, gives a range possible match scores 
(Result Points or RP), and stores user's own wins and losses in a dictionary based on the characters that they play.


Instructions:
The program will prompt you to which section you want to run and to press enter or q to close the program. You will need to run the program again to use different sections. In the Record section, you must input the characters name as displayed in-game (i.e. January cannot be written as Jan). Otherwise the dictionary will not recognize the name.

Any Dependencies:
No additional files need to run.

Completion Statement:
Every part works to the best of my knowledge. I was not able to parse the global stats from any website so I created a defined dictionary in Section 1/"Global"/


Resources Used:
Official website with global statistics:
https://www.residentevil.net/en/resistancestats.html
Official manual that has information on how the matches score is calculated:
https://game.capcom.com/manual/resistance/en/ps4/page/4/1
Has statistics on characters used, and win and loss rates, and which maps games were won on, much more detailed than the official site. The data is in charts:
https://resistance.eth4.rocks/en/
Has some general non win rate stats about the game I used for calculations:

Some information about the match scores from players:

Used this streamer's matches as well as my own to estimate match points/result points:

Future additions:
I would have liked to added a damage calculation estimator. The issue with that is that there are so many factors that go into that, with all 12 characters, nearly 100 equipment, and each characters varying skills that would create multipliers to damange, and I would have to test out all the combinations
myself many times to get an accurate estimation.

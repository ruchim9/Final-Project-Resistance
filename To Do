To do list:
*Create equation that estimates match score.
*Determine how to present win and loss statistics. The non- official website isnâ€™t clear what the number of wins means, it is in decimals.
*Make working code to read website statistics (There are some issues I foresee coming with reading numbers that are on images).
*Make equation that once it receives the numbers from the websites, it calculates the win rates for each character.
